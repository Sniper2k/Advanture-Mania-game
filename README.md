# Advanture-Mania-game
Prototype for game

Advanture mania is prototype for Cocos2D based game/ It's rogue-like game, where hero travel labirynthed dungeon full of traps and monsters searching for treasures. It's a turn based movement.In protoype there's one enemy in labirinth/ When you conact him, game travels to battle view/ Is still unfinished/ Game has memory-leech due to unreleased CCSprites(every where in code. I realised tis problem when stopped working with on this).
